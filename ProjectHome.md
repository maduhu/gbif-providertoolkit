### IPT Moving to GitHub ###
-_May 15, 2015_

The IPT source code and issue tracking is now managed in GitHub and available at the following address: https://github.com/gbif/ipt

The reason this project is moving to GitHub, is that Google is bidding farewell to Google Code. You can read more about how Google Code is being phased out [here](http://google-opensource.blogspot.dk/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html).

The IPT User Manual and Wiki is still in the process of being migrated. Therefore until the User Manual and Wiki migration is complete, please continue to use the versions found here, in the IPT's Google Code site.

### IPT v2.2.1 has been released! ###
-_April 20, 2015_

This minor version fixes an [issue](https://code.google.com/p/gbif-providertoolkit/issues/detail?id=1155) where the download for the Darwin Core Archive file does not appear on the resource homepage. This problem only affects IPT 2.2, and only happens when the IPT's Archival Mode has been turned off.

To fix this problem, simply download IPT v2.2.1 [here](http://repository.gbif.org/content/groups/gbif/org/gbif/ipt/2.2.1/ipt-2.2.1.war), and upgrade your IPT to this version following the usual upgrade instructions provided in the [Release Notes](IPTReleaseNotes22.md).
